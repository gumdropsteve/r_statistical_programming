# Potential Questions to Answer:
# 1. Create snacks that the customers can buy and randomize who buys which snack
# 2. Pretend you own multiple theaters and run two simulations to represent each theater and plot the results
# 3. Create conditional statements for movies that may be PG-13 and children are not allowed to watch

# Cost for adults and children
ticket_cost <- ? 
ticket_cost_child <- ? 
movies <- c('', '', '', '', '')  # List 5 of your favorite movies
screens <-  # How many screens does the theater have? (assume 1 per movie)
seats <-  # How many seats does each theater hold
week_days <- rep(0, 7)  # Store totals for each day

# iterate through the week
for () {
  
  # Keep track of total revenue for the day

  
  # iterate through the amount of screens on a particular day
  for () {
    
    # Calculate  how many adults and children are watching the movie
    visitors_adults <- sample(, 1)
    visitors_children <- sample((),1)
    
    # Calculate the revenue for adults and children
    
    
    # Calculate revenue, and add to running total for the day
    
    
  }
  # Save total to the corresponding day
  
}

# Make a barchart showing total revenue per day
  
# Make any other chart

# Which day had the highest revenue?
